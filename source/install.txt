Prerequisites
-------------

Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|compass| works with MongoDB Server version 3.0 and higher, both
Enterprise and Community editions. It runs on 64-bit versions
of Mac macOS, Windows, Ubuntu 14.04+ and RHEL 7+.

Software requirements to run |compass-short| are listed below:

.. include:: /includes/fact-compass-platforms.rst

.. note::

   The Windows installation of |compass| requires
   **Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later.** The
   |compass-short| installer prompts you to install the
   minimum required version of the .NET framework if it is
   not already installed on your system.

Network Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain features of |compass|, such as third-party mapping services and
Intercom, require inbound connections from external sources to
function. In some instances, users have reported issues with their
system firewall blocking these network requests and thereby limiting
|compass| functionalities. To fix this issue, configure your system
firewall to allow incoming connections for |compass|.

.. important::

   Ensure ports ``80`` and ``443`` are open between |compass| and the
   host for the MongoDB Instance to which Compass connects.
