            The Windows installation of |compass| requires
            `Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653>`__.
            The |compass-short| installer prompts you to install the 
            minimum required version of the .NET framework if it is 
            not already installed on your system.

         later and MongoDB 3.0 or later.

Network Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain features of |compass|, such as third-party mapping services and
Intercom, require inbound connections from external sources to
function. In some instances, users have reported issues with their
system firewall blocking these network requests and thereby limiting
|compass| functionalities.

To fix this issue, configure your system firewall to allow incoming
connections for |compass|. Ensure ports ``80`` and ``443`` are open
between |compass| and the host for the MongoDB Instance to which
|compass-short| connects.
